1.	Enhanced File Structure:
	•	Refined and expanded file structure to include a complete breakdown of directories and files, covering contracts, scripts, services, and hooks.
	•	Inclusion of services/api.js and services/blockchain.js for modular external API and blockchain logic.
	•	Addition of test cases for both token and oracle contracts in tests/.
	2.	Smart Contract Improvements:
	•	Introduced DJIAOracle.sol for real-time DJIA price feeds using Chainlink oracles.
	•	Improved deployment scripts and modular migrations in contracts/migrations/deploy.js.
	3.	Frontend Features:
	•	Defined React components (Header, Footer, TokenCard) for a reusable UI structure.
	•	Added Home, About, and Dashboard pages for better navigation.
	•	Implemented custom hooks (useFetchDJIA and useBlockchain) for data fetching and blockchain interactions.
	4.	Scripts & Utilities:
	•	Utility scripts for deploying contracts (deploy-contract.js) and updating price feeds (update-oracle.js).
	•	Enhanced automation via scripts for real-time oracle updates.
	5.	Whitepaper & README Enhancements:
	•	Revised whitepaper with the updated project scope and architecture.
	•	Comprehensive README.md with added sections for prerequisites, installation, and deployment instructions.
	6.	Testing & Deployment:
	•	Created robust tests (test-djia-token.js and test-oracle.js) for end-to-end smart contract verification.
	•	Included instructions for deploying the application and testing contracts.

This iteration emphasizes modularity, maintainability, and real-world usability. Let me know if you want to explore or refine any specific part further!
