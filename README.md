Overview

The DJIA Token platform tokenizes the DJIA index, allowing users to invest in a blockchain-based representation of the index. With Chainlink-powered oracles, automated dividend distribution, and a React-based frontend, the platform offers a seamless user experience.

Features
	•	Decentralized Investment: Easily invest in a tokenized version of the DJIA index.
	•	Real-Time Price Updates: Get the latest DJIA prices using Chainlink oracles.
	•	Dividend Distribution: Smart contract-based automated dividends.
	•	Secure and Transparent: Powered by Ethereum and audited smart contracts.
	•	User-Friendly Interface: Responsive and intuitive React-based frontend.

Usage

Run the Development Server

Start the React frontend:

npm start

Access the app at http://localhost:3000.

Deploy Contracts

Deploy smart contracts to the Goerli testnet:

npm run deploy

Build for Production

Create a production build:

npm run build

Smart Contracts

DJIAToken.sol

An ERC-20 token representing the DJIA index. Features include:
	•	Minting and burning
	•	Dividend distribution

DJIAOracle.sol

Uses Chainlink oracles to fetch real-time DJIA prices.

Deployment

Contracts are deployed using the Hardhat framework. Update scripts/deploy-contract.js for network-specific configurations.

Testing

Run Unit Tests

Execute tests for the contracts:

npx hardhat test
